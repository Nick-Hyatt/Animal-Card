			<p>The domestic cat is believed to have evolved from the Near Eastern wildcat, 
				whose range covers vast portions of the Middle East westward to the Atlantic 
				coast of Africa. Between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago the animal gave rise 
				to the genetic lineage that eventually produced all domesticated cats, having 
				diverged from the Near Eastern wildcat around 8,000 BC in the Middle East</p>
